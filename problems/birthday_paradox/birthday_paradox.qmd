# Statement 

From Wikipedia:

> In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a 
> set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday 
> paradox refers to the counterintuitive fact that only 23 people are needed for 
> that probability to exceed 50%.

# Approach 1

Lets find a formula for the probability of no people from a group sharing the same 
birthday, and then we find it's complement. Let $E$ be the event that no people 
from a group of $r$ people share the same birthday, and let $P(E)$ be the event's 
probability:

$$
P(E) = \frac{ {}^{365}P_{r} }{ 365^r }
$$

The complement of $P(E)$ is the probability that at least two people share a 
birthday:

$$
P(E') = 1 - \frac{ {}^{365}P_{r} }{ 365^r }
$$

From inspection of the below plot we can see that when $r = 23$ the probability 
$P(E') \ge 0.5$. This means that in a group of 23 (or more) people the probability 
that two or more people share a birthday $P(E') \ge 0.5$ or $P(E') \ge 50\%$.

# Approach 2

Another approach is to consider the number of pairs there are among $r$ people:

$$
n = {}^{r}C_{2}
$$

The probability that each person in a pair has a different birthday is:

$$
P(B') = \frac{364}{365}
$$

as the first person has $365$ choices (out of $365$ days) for their borthday, and if 
there is to be no shared birthday the second person would have $364$ choices (out of 
$365$ days) for their birthday. The probability that for all pairs, each person has 
a different birthday: 

$$
P(E) = \left( \frac{364}{365} \right)^n
$$

as there are $n$ pairs from above. Hence the probability that at least one pair 
people share a birthday is the complement of the above probability:

$$
P(E') = 1 - \left( \frac{364}{365} \right)^n
$$

From inspection of the below plot we can see that the probability $P(E') \ge 0.5$ 
for $n = 253$ which happens to be ${}^{23}C_{2}$. So for a group of 23 people, the 
probability of finding a shared birthday among the group is $\ge 50%$.
