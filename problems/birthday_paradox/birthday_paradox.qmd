# Statement 

From Wikipedia:

> In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a 
> set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday 
> paradox refers to the counterintuitive fact that only 23 people are needed for 
> that probability to exceed 50%.

# Approach 1

We first define the probability that no people from a group share the same 
birthday, and then we find it's complement. 

\vspace{1em}

Let $E$ be the event that no people share the same birthday from a group of 
$r$ people, and let $P(E)$ be the event's probability.

\vspace{1em}

To calculate the first probability we observe that the first person has $365$ 
options out of $365$ days to be born on, the second person has $364$ options 
out of $365$ days to be born on, and so on:

\vspace{1em}

\begin{align*}
P(E) & = \frac{ 365 }{ 365 } \times \frac{ 364 }{ 365 } \times ... \times \frac{ 365 - r + 1 }{ 365 } \\\\
     & = \frac{ 365! }{ 365^r (365 - r)! } \\\\
     & = \frac{ {}^{365}P_{r} }{ 365^r }
\end{align*}

\vspace{1em}

The complement of $P(E)$ is the probability that at least two people share a 
birthday:

\vspace{1em}

$$
P(E') = 1 - \frac{ {}^{365}P_{r} }{ 365^r }
$$

\vspace{1em}

Below is a table of $P(E')$ for $r$ between $20$ and $24$:

\vspace{1em}

| $r$  | $P(E')$ |
|------|---------|
| $20$ | $0.411$ |
| $21$ | $0.444$ |
| $22$ | $0.476$ |
| $23$ | $0.507$ |
| $24$ | $0.538$ |

\vspace{1em}

And inspection of the below plot we can see that when $r = 23$ the probability 
$P(E') \ge 0.5$.

\vspace{1em}

This means that in a group of 23 (or more) people the probability that two or 
more people share a birthday $P(E') \ge 0.5$ or $P(E') \ge 50\%$.

# Approach 2

Another approach is to consider the number of pairs there are among $r$ people:

\vspace{1em}

$$
n = {}^{r}C_{2}
$$

\vspace{1em}

The probability that each person in a pair has a different birthday is:

\vspace{1em}

$$
P(B') = \frac{364}{365}
$$

\vspace{1em}

as the first person has $365$ choices (out of $365$ days) for their birthday, and if 
there is to be no shared birthday the second person would have $364$ choices (out of 
$365$ days) for their birthday. The probability that for all pairs, each person has 
a different birthday: 

\vspace{1em}

$$
P(E) = \left( \frac{364}{365} \right)^n
$$

\vspace{1em}

as there are $n$ pairs from above. Hence the probability that at least one pair people 
share a birthday is the complement of the above probability:

\vspace{1em}

$$
P(E') = 1 - \left( \frac{364}{365} \right)^n
$$

\vspace{1em}

![Probability that at least one pair of people share a birthday](../../images/birthday_paradox/birthday_paradox_02.png){width=50%}

\vspace{1em}

From inspection of the above plot we can see that the probability $P(E') \ge 0.5$ 
for $n = 253$ which happens to be ${}^{23}C_{2}$. So for a group of 23 people, the 
probability of finding a shared birthday among the group is $\ge 50\%$.
